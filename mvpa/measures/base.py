"""Base class for data measures: algorithms that quantify properties of
datasets.

Besides the `DatasetMeasure` base class this module also provides the
(abstract) `FeaturewiseDatasetMeasure` class. The difference between a general
measure and the output of the `FeaturewiseDatasetMeasure` is that the latter
returns a 1d map (one value per feature in the dataset). In contrast there are
no restrictions on the returned value of `DatasetMeasure` except for that it
has to be in some iterable container.

    All dataset measures support arbitrary transformation of the measure
    after it has been computed. Transformation are done by processing the
    measure with a functor that is specified via the `transformer` keyword
    argument of the constructor. Upon request, the raw measure (before
    transformations are applied) is stored in the `raw_result` state variable.

    Additionally all dataset measures support the estimation of the
    probabilit(y,ies) of a measure under some distribution. Typically this will
    be the NULL distribution (no signal), that can be estimated with
    permutation tests. If a distribution estimator instance is passed to the
    `null_dist` keyword argument of the constructor the respective
    probabilities are automatically computed and stored in the `null_prob`
    state variable.

    :Developer note:
      All subclasses shall get all necessary parameters via their constructor,
      so it is possible to get the same type of measure for multiple datasets
      by passing them to the __call__() method successively.
