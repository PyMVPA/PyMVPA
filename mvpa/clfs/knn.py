    k-Nearest-Neighbour classifier.

    This is a simple classifier that bases its decision on the distances
    between the training dataset samples and the test sample(s). Distances
    are computed using a customizable distance function. A certain number
    (`k`)of nearest neighbors is selected based on the smallest distances
    and the labels of this neighboring samples are fed into a voting
    function to determine the labels of the test sample.

    Training a kNN classifier is extremely quick, as no actuall training
    is performed as the training dataset is simply stored in the
    classifier. All computations are done during classifier prediction.

    .. note::
      If enabled, kNN stores the votes per class in the 'values' state after
      calling predict().
