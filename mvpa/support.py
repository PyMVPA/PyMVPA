    patterns. Such a pattern set is defined by a starting point and the size
    of the window along the first axis of the data ('boxlength').

    Parameters:
        data:           An array with an arbitrary number of dimensions.
        startpoints:    A sequence of index value along the first axis of
                        'data'.
        boxlength:      The number of elements after 'startpoint' along the
                        first axis of 'data' to be considered for averaging.
        offset:         The offset between the starting point and the
                        averaging window (boxcar).

    The functions returns an array with the length of the first axis being
    equal to the length of the 'startpoints' sequence.
