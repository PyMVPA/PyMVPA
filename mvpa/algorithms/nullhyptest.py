    transfer errors.

    No assumptions are made about the distribution of the errors under the null
    hypothesis. Instead this distribution is estimated by performing multiple
    classification attempts with permuted `label` vectors, hence no or random
    signal (abrv. RTE: random transfer error). After a customizable number of
    permutations another transfer error is computed using the original `label`
    vector (abrv. ETE: empirical transfer error).

    The `__call__()` method finally returns the fraction of RTEs that are of
    *lower or equal* value than the ETE. This value is an estimate of the
    probability to achieve a transfer error as low or lower as the ETE, when
    the data samples contain *no* signal.
