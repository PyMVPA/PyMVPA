    """Align the features across multiple datasets into a common feature space.

    This is a three-level algorithm. In the first level, a series of input
    datasets is projected into a common feature space using a configurable
    mapper. The common space is initially defined by a chosen exemplar from the
    list of input datasets, but is subsequently refined by iteratively combining
    the common space with the projected input datasets.

    In the second (optional) level, the original input datasets are again
    aligned with (or projected into) the intermediate first-level common
    space. Through a configurable number of iterations the common space is
    further refined by repeated projections of the input datasets and
    combination/aggregation of these projections into an updated common space.

    In the third level, the input datasets are again aligned with the, now
    final, common feature space. The output of this algorithm are trained
    mappers (one for each input dataset) that transform the individual features
    spaces into the common space.

    Level 1 and 2 are performed by the ``train()`` method, and level 3 is
    performed when the trained Hyperalignment instance is called with a list of
    datasets. This dataset list may or may not be identical to the training
    datasets.

    The default values for the parameters of the algorithm (e.g. projection via
    Procrustean transformation, common space aggregation by averaging) resemble
    the setup reported in :ref:`Haxby et al., Neuron (2011) <HGC+11>` *A common,
    high-dimensional model of the representational space in human ventral
    temporal cortex.*
