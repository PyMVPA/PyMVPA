    Required behavior:

    For every classifier is has to be possible to be instantiated without
    having to specify the training pattern.

    Repeated calls to the train() method with different training data have to
    result in a valid classifier, trained for the particular dataset.

    It must be possible to specify all classifier parameters as keyword
    arguments to the constructor.

    Recommended behavior:

    Derived classifiers should provide access to *estimates* -- i.e. that
    information that is finally used to determine the predicted class label.

    Michael: Maybe it works well if each classifier provides a 'estimates'
             state member. This variable is a list as long as and in same order
             as Dataset.uniquetargets (training data). Each item in the list
             corresponds to the likelyhood of a sample to belong to the
             respective class. However the semantics might differ between
             classifiers, e.g. kNN would probably store distances to class-
             neighbors, where PLR would store the raw function value of the
             logistic function. So in the case of kNN low is predictive and for
             PLR high is predictive. Don't know if there is the need to unify
             that.

             As the storage and/or computation of this information might be
             demanding its collection should be switchable and off be default.

    Nomenclature
     * predictions  : result of the last call to .predict()
     * estimates : might be different from predictions if a classifier's predict()
                   makes a decision based on some internal value such as
                   probability or a distance.
