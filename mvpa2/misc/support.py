    The class is basically a dictionary. Any properties can
    be passed as keyword arguments to the constructor, e.g.:

      >>> ev = Event(onset=12, duration=2.45)

    Conventions for keys:

    `onset`
      The onset of the event in some unit.
    `duration`
      The duration of the event in the same unit as `onset`.
    `label`
      E.g. the condition this event is part of.
    `chunk`
      Group this event is part of (if any), e.g. experimental run.
    `features`
      Any amount of additional features of the event. This might include
      things like physiological measures, stimulus intensity. Must be a mutable
      sequence (e.g. list), if present.
