Examples
********

Each of the following examples is a stand-alone script containing all
necessary code to run some analysis. All examples are shipped with PyMVPA and
can be found in the `doc/examples/` directory in the source package. This
directory include some more special-interest examples which are not listed
here.



Simple Plotting of Classifier Behavior
======================================

This example runs a number of classifiers on a simple dataset and plots the
decision surface of each classifier.

.. literalinclude:: examples/pylab_2d.py


Easy Searchlight
================

Run a searchlight analysis on the example fMRI dataset that is shipped with
PyMVPA.

.. literalinclude:: examples/searchlight_2d.py


Sensitivity Measure
===================

Run some basic and meta sensitivity measures on the example fMRI dataset that
comes with PyMVPA and plot the computed featurewise measures for each.

.. literalinclude:: examples/sensanas.py


Classification of SVD-mapped Datasets
=====================================

Demonstrate the usage of a dataset mapper performing singular value
decomposition within a cross-validation.

.. literalinclude:: examples/svdclf.py


Compare SMLR to Linear SVM Classifier
=====================================

Runs both classifiers on the the same dataset and compare their performance.
This example also shows an example usage of confusion matrices and how two
classifers can be combined.
