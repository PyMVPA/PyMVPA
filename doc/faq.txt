I am tired of writing these endless import blocks. Any alternative?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Sure. Instead of individually importing all pieces that are required
  by a script, you can import them all at once. A simple::

    import mvpa.suite as mvpa

  makes everything directly accessible through the mvpa namespace, e.g.
  `mvpa.datasets.base.Dataset` becomes `mvpa.Dataset`. Really lazy people
  can even do::

    from mvpa.suite import *

  However, as always there is a price to pay for this convenience. In contrast
  to the individual imports there is some intial performance and memory cost. In
  the worst case you'll get all external dependencies loaded (e.g. a full R
  session), just because you have them installed. Therefore, it might be better
  to limit this use to case where individual key presses matter and use
  individual imports for production scripts.


I feel like I want to contribute something, do you mind?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Not at all! If you think there is something that is not well explained in
  the documentation, send us an improvement. If you implemented a new algorithm
  using PyMVPA that you want to share, please share. If you have an idea for
  some other improvement (e.g. speed, functionality), but you have no
  time/cannot/do not want to implement it yourself, please post your idea to
  the PyMVPA mailing list.


The manual is quite insufficient. When will you improve it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Writing a manual can be a tricky task if you already know the details and
  have to imagine what might be the most interesting information for someone
  who is just starting. If you feel that something is missing which has cost
  you some time to figure out, please drop us a note and we will add it as soon
  as possible. If you have developed some code snippets to demonstrate some
  feature or non-trivial behaviour, please consider sharing this snippet with
  us and we will put it into the example collection or the manual. Thanks!
