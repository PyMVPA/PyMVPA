General

.. index:: optimization

It is sloooooow. What can I do?
-------------------------------

  Have you tried running the Python interpreter with `-O`? PyMVPA provides
  lots of debug messages with information that is computed in addition to the
  work that really has to be done. However, if Python is running in
  *optimized* mode, PyMVPA will not waste time on this and really tries to be
  fast.

  If you are already running it optimized, then maybe you are doing something
  really demanding...


I am tired of writing these endless import blocks. Any alternative?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Sure. Instead of individually importing all pieces that are required
  by a script, you can import them all at once. A simple:

    >>> import mvpa.suite as mvpa

  makes everything directly accessible through the mvpa namespace, e.g.
  `mvpa.datasets.base.Dataset` becomes `mvpa.Dataset`. Really lazy people
  can even do:

    >>> from mvpa.suite import *

  However, as always there is a price to pay for this convenience. In contrast
  to the individual imports there is some initial performance and memory cost. In
  the worst case you'll get all external dependencies loaded (e.g. a full R
  session), just because you have them installed. Therefore, it might be better
  to limit this use to case where individual key presses matter and use
  individual imports for production scripts.


I feel like I want to contribute something, do you mind?
--------------------------------------------------------

  Not at all! If you think there is something that is not well explained in
  the documentation, send us an improvement. If you implemented a new algorithm
  using PyMVPA that you want to share, please share. If you have an idea for
  some other improvement (e.g. speed, functionality), but you have no
  time/cannot/do not want to implement it yourself, please post your idea to
  the PyMVPA mailing list.


.. index:: Git, development

I want to develop a new feature for PyMVPA. How can I do it efficiently?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The best way is to use Git for both, getting the latest code from the
  repository and preparing the patch. Here is a quick sketch of the workflow.

  First get the latest code::

    git clone git://git.debian.org/git/pkg-exppsy/pymvpa.git

  This will create a new `pymvpa` subdirectory, that contains the complete
  repository. Enter this directory and run `gitk --all` to browse the full
  history and *all* branches that have ever been published.

  You can run::

    git fetch origin

  in this directory at any time to get the latest changes from the main
  repository.

  Next, you have to decide what you want to base your new feature on. In the
  simplest case this is the `master` branch (the one that contains the code that
  will become the next release). Creating a local branch based on the (remote)
  `master` branch is::

    git checkout -b my_hack origin/master

  Now you are ready to start hacking. You are free to use all powers of Git
  (and yours, of course). You can do multiple commits, fetch new stuff from the
  repository, and merge it into your local branch, ... To get a feeling what can
  be done, take a look `very short description of Git`_ or `a more
  comprehensive Git tutorial`_.

.. _very short description of Git: http://sysmonblog.co.uk/misc/git_by_example/
.. _a more comprehensive Git tutorial: http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/

  When you are done with the new feature, you can prepare the patch for
  inclusion into PyMVPA. If you have done multiple commits you might want to
  squash them into a single patch containing the new feature. You can do this
  with `git-rebase`. In recent version `git-rebase` has an option
  `--interactive`, which allows you to easily pick, squash or even further edit
  any of the previous commits you have made. Rebase your local branch against
  the remote branch you started hacking on (`origin/master` in this example)::

    git rebase --interactive origin/master

  When you are done, you can generate the final patch file::

     git-format-patch origin/master

  Above command will generate a file for each commit in you local branch that is
  not yet part of `origin/master`. The patch files can then be easily emailed.


The manual is quite insufficient. When will you improve it?
-----------------------------------------------------------

  Writing a manual can be a tricky task if you already know the details and
  have to imagine what might be the most interesting information for someone
  who is just starting. If you feel that something is missing which has cost
  you some time to figure out, please drop us a note and we will add it as
  soon as possible. If you have developed some code snippets to demonstrate
  some feature or non-trivial behavior (maybe even trivial ones, which are
  not as obvious as they should be), please consider sharing this snippet with
  us and we will put it into the example collection or the manual. Thanks!


Data import, export and storage
===============================

What file formats are understood by PyMVPA?
-------------------------------------------

Please see the :ref:`data_formats` section.


What if there is no special file format for some particular datatype?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

With the :class:`~mvpa.misc.io.hamster.Hamster` class, PyMVPA
supports storing *any* kind of serializable data into a
(compressed) file (see the class documentation for a trivial
usage example). The facility is particularly useful for storing
any number of intermediate analysis results, e.g. for
post-processing.


Data preprocessing
==================

.. index:: invariant features

Is there an easy way to remove invariant features from a dataset?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  You might have to deal with invariant features in case like an fMRI dataset,
  where the *brain mask* is slightly larger than the thresholded fMRI
  timeseries image. Such invariant features (i.e. features with zero variance)
  are sometime a problem, e.g. they will lead to numerical difficulties when
  z-scoring the features of a dataset (i.e. division by zero).

  The `mvpa.datasets.miscfx` module provides a convenience function
  `removeInvariantFeatures()` that strips such features from a dataset.


.. index:: block-averaging

How can I do :term:`block-averaging` of my block-design fMRI dataset?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  The easiest way is to use a mapper to transform/average the respective
  samples. Suppose you have a dataset:

  >>> dataset = normalFeatureDataset()
  >>> dataset
  <Dataset / float64 100 x 4 uniq: 2 labels 5 chunks labels_mapped>

  Averaging all samples with the same label in each chunk individually is done
  by applying a samples mapper to the dataset.

  >>> from mvpa.mappers.samplegroup import SampleGroupMapper
  >>> from mvpa.misc.transformers import FirstAxisMean
  >>>
  >>> m = SampleGroupMapper(fx=FirstAxisMean)
  >>> mapped_dataset = dataset.applyMapper(samplesmapper=m)
  >>> mapped_dataset
  <Dataset / float64 10 x 4 uniq: 2 labels 5 chunks labels_mapped>

  `SampleGroupMapper` applies a function to every group of samples in each
  chunk individually. Using `FirstAxisMean` as function, therefore yields
  one sample of each label per chunk.



Data analysis
=============

.. index:: feature selection, feature_ids

How do I know which features were finally selected by a classifier doing feature selection?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All classifier possess a state variable `feature_ids`. When enable, the
classifier stores the ids of all features that were finally used to train
the classifier.

  >>> clf = FeatureSelectionClassifier(
  ...           kNN(k=5),
  ...           SensitivityBasedFeatureSelection(
  ...               SMLRWeights(SMLR(lm=1.0), transformer=Absolute),
  ...               FixedNElementTailSelector(1, tail='upper', mode='select')),
  ...           enable_states = ['feature_ids'])
  >>> clf.train(dataset)
  >>> final_dataset = dataset.selectFeatures(clf.feature_ids)
  >>> final_dataset
  <Dataset / float64 100 x 1 uniq: 2 labels 5 chunks labels_mapped>

In the above code snippet a kNN classifier is defined, that performs a feature
selection step prior training. Features are selected according to the absolute
magnitude of the weights of a SMLR classifier trained on the data (same training
data that will also go into kNN). Absolute SMLR weights are used for feature
selection as large negative values also indicate important information. Finally,
the classifier is configured to select the single most important feature (given
the SMLR weights). After enabling the `feature_ids` state, the classifier
provides the desired information, that can e.g. be applied to generate a
stripped dataset for an analysis of the similarity structure.


.. index:: sensitivity, cross-validation

How do I extract sensitivities from a classifier used within a cross-validation?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. The answer depends on size of the classification problem and the used
   classifier. If you can afford to keep a copy of the trained classifier for
   each data split, the most elegant solution is probably a :class:`~mvpa.clfs.base.SplitClassifier`...
   ...BUT no yet

:class:`~mvpa.algorithms.cvtranserror.CrossValidatedTransferError` provides an interface to access any
classifier-related information: `harvest_attribs`. Harvesting the sensitivities
computed by all classifiers (without recomputing them again) looks like this:

  >>> cv = CrossValidatedTransferError(
  ...       TransferError(SMLR()),
  ...       OddEvenSplitter(),
  ...       harvest_attribs=\
  ...        ['transerror.clf.getSensitivityAnalyzer(force_training=False)()'])
  >>> merror = cv(dataset)
  >>> sensitivities = cv.harvested.values()[0]
  >>> N.array(sensitivities).shape == (2, dataset.nfeatures)
  True

First, we define an instance of :class:`~mvpa.algorithms.cvtranserror.CrossValidatedTransferError` that uses an SMLR_
classifier to perform the cross-validation on odd-even splits of a dataset.
The important piece is the definition of the `harvest_attribs`.  It takes a
list of code snippets that will be executed in the local context of the
cross-validation function. The :class:`~mvpa.clfs.transerror.TransferError` instance used to train and test
the classifier on each split is available via `transerror`. The rest is easy:
:class:`~mvpa.clfs.transerror.TransferError` provides access to its classifier and any classifier can in turn
generate an appropriate :class:`~mvpa.measures.base.Sensitivity` instance via `getSensitivityAnalyzer()`.
This generator method takes additional arguments to the constructor of the
:class:`mvpa.measures.base.Sensitivity` class. In this case we want to prevent retraining the classifiers,
as they will be trained anyway by the :class:`~mvpa.clfs.transerror.TransferError` instance they belong to.

The return values of all code snippets defined in `harvest_attribs` are
available in the `harvested` state variable. `harvested` is a dictionary where
the keys are the code snippets used to compute the value. As the key in this
case is pretty long, we simply take the first (and only) value from the
dictionary.  The value is actually a list of sensitivity vectors, one per
split.

.. _faq_literal_labels:

Can PyMVPA deal with literal class labels?
------------------------------------------

Yes and no. In general the classifiers wrapped or implemented in PyMVPA are not
capable of handling literal labels, some even might require binary labels.
However, PyMVPA datasets provide functionality to map any set of literal labels
to a corresponding set of numerical labels. Let's take a look:

  >>> # invent some samples (arbitrary in this example)
  >>> samples = N.random.randn(3).reshape(3,1)

First we will construct a Dataset the usual way (3 samples with unique numerical
labels, all in one chunk:

  >>> Dataset(samples=samples, labels=range(3), chunks=1)
  <Dataset / float64 3 x 1 uniq: 3 labels 1 chunks>

Now, we are trying to create the same dataset using literal labels:

  >>> # now create the same dataset using literal labels
  >>> ds = Dataset(samples=samples,
  ...              labels=['one', 'two', 'three'],
  ...              chunks=1)
  >>> ds.labels[0]
  'one'

This approach simply stored the literal labels in the dataset and will most
likely lead to unpredictable behavior of classifiers that cannot handle them.
A more flexible approach is to let the dataset map the literal labels to
numerical ones:

  >>> ds = Dataset(samples=samples,
  ...              labels=['one', 'two', 'three'],
  ...              chunks=1,
  ...              labels_map=True)
  >>> ds
  <Dataset / float64 3 x 1 uniq: 3 labels 1 chunks labels_mapped>
  >>> ds.labels[0]
  0
  >>> for k in sorted(ds.labels_map.keys()):
  ...     print k, ds.labels_map[k]
  one 0
  three 1
  two 2

With this approach the labels stored in the dataset are now numerical. However,
the mapping between literal and numerical labels is somewhat arbitrary. If a
fixed mapping is possible or intended (e.g. same mapping for multiple dataset),
the mapping can be set explicitly:

  >>> ds = Dataset(samples=samples,
  ...              labels=['one', 'two', 'three'],
  ...              chunks=1,
  ...              labels_map={'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3})
  >>> for k in sorted(ds.labels_map.keys()):
  ...     print k, ds.labels_map[k]
  one 1
  three 3
  two 2

PyMVPA will use the labels mapping to display literal instead of numerical
labels e.g. in confusion matrices.
