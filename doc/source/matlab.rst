PyMVPA for Matlab Users
***********************

If you are coming from Matlab, you will soon notice a lot of similarities
between Matlab and Python (besides the huge advantages of Python over Matlab).
For an easy transition you might want to have a look at a `basic comparison of
Matlab and NumPy`_.

It would be nice to have some guidelines on how to use PyMVPA for users who are
already familiar with the `Matlab MVPA toolbox`_. If you are using both
packages and could compile a few tips, your contribution would be most welcome.

A recent paper by :ref:`Jurica and van Leeuwen (2009) <JL09>` describes an
open-source MATLABÂ®-to-Python compiler which might be a very useful tool to
migrate a substantial amount of Matlab-based source code to Python and
therefore also aids the migration of developers from Matlab to the new *"general
open-source lingua franca for scientific computation"*.
