**********************
Command line interface
**********************

Since version 2.3 PyMVPA includes a command line interface that allows for
using PyMVPA in shell scripts and other non-Python environments. When installed
PyMVPA offers a single command :command:`pymvpa2` through which all supported
functionality is available. Analogous to the Python interface the command line
interface is broken down into modules that individually serve a specific
purpose, but can be combined into more complex analysis pipelines. Each module
is exposed as a sub-command of :command:`pymvpa2`. All sub-commands are
documented individually below.

Both the primary :command:`pymvpa2`, as well as all sub-commands support
specific options that need to be given in the right location on the command
line. The basic structure of any command line is this::

  $ pymvpa2 [{{primary options}}] [{{sub-command}} [{{secondary options}}]

where ``primary options`` are any options for the main :command:`pymvpa2`
command, and ``secondary options`` are options of a sub-command. For example::

  $ pymvpa2 --help

will yield the documentation of the main command, but::

  $ pymvpa2 info --help

will yield the documentation of the ``info`` sub-command.

Documentation of the main ``pymvpa2`` command
=============================================

The documentation of the :command:`pymvpa2` command (accessible via ``--help``)
includes a list of all available sub-commands on a particular system.
