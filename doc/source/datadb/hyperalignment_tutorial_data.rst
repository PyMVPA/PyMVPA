Hypearalignment Tutorial Data: Faces and Objects in Ventral Temporal Cortex (fMRI)
**********************************************************************************

This is a block-design fMRI dataset from a study on face and object
representation in human ventral temporal cortex.  It consists of 10 subjects
with 8 runs per subject. In each run, the subjects passively viewed greyscale
images from seven face & object categories. Each image was shown for 500ms
and was followed by a 1500ms inter-stimulus interval.  Full-brain fMRI data
were recorded with a volume repetition time of 2.5s, thus, a stimulus block
was covered by roughly 16 volumes. For a complete description of the experimental
design, fMRI acquisition parameters, and preprocessing steps, and previously
obtained results see the references_ below.

This tutorial dataset is based on data from a study published by :ref:`Haxby
et al. (2011) <HGC+11>`. The datasets have been preprocessed to a degree that should
allow people without prior fMRI experience to perform meaningful analyses.
Moreover, it should not require further preprocessing with external tools.

All preprocessing has been performed using tools from AFNI & PyMVPA.
Specifically, the 4D fMRI timeseries has been preprocessed as described in
:ref: `Haxby et al. (2011) <HGC+11>` and aligned to the standard MNI brain.
A Ventral Temporal Cortex mask in MNI space is applied to the data.
