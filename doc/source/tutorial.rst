Tutorial Introductions Into General Python Programming
------------------------------------------------------

`http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer's_Tutorial_for_Python_2.0`

  Basic from-scratch introduction into Python. This should give you the basics,
  even if you had *no* prior programming experience.

http://www.ibiblio.org/swaroopch/byteofpython/read/

  From the author:

    The aim is that if all you know about computers is how to save text files,
    then you can learn Python from this book. If you have previous programming
    experience, then you can also learn Python from this book.

http://diveintopython.org

  A famous tutorial that served as the entry-point into Python for many people.
  However, it has a relatively steep learning curve, and also covers various
  topics which aren't in the focus of scientific computing.

http://docs.python.org/tutorial/

  Written by the creator of Python itself, this is a more comprehensive, but
  also more compressed tutorial that can also serve as a reference. Recommended
  as resource for people with basic programming experience in *some* language.


Scientific Computing In Python
------------------------------

http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial

  Useful for a first glimpse at NumPy -- the basis for scientific computing in
  Python.

http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/

  Valuable resource for people coming from other languages and environments,
  such as Matlab.  This pages offers cheat sheets with the equivalents of
  commands and expressions in various languages, including Matlab, R and
  Python.

http://www.tramy.us/numpybook.pdf

  This is *the* comprehensive reference manual of the NumPy package. It gives
  answers to questions, yet to be asked.
