****************
Module Reference
****************

This module reference extends the manual with a comprehensive overview of the
currently available functionality, that is built into PyMVPA. However, instead
of a full list including every single line of the PyMVPA code base, this
reference limits itself to the relevant pieces of the application programming
interface (API) that are of particular interest to users of this framework.

Each module in the package is documented by a general summary of its
purpose and the list of classes and functions it provides.

For developers, more detailed (technical) information is available in the
`API reference`_.
