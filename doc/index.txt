==================================================
 PyMVPA - Multivariate Pattern Analysis in Python
==================================================


Pie ... what?
-------------

PyMVPA is a Python_ module intended to ease pattern classification
analyses of large datasets. It provides high-level abstraction of typical
processing steps and a number of implementations of some popular algorithms.
While it is not limited to neuroimaging data it is eminently suited for such
datasets. PyMVPA is truely free software (in every respect) and additonally
requires nothing but free-software to run. Theoretically PyMVPA should run
on anything that can run a Python_ interpreter, although the proof is yet to
come.

PyMVPA stands for **M**\ ulti\ **V**\ ariate **P**\ attern **A**\ nalysis
in **Py**\ thon.

To learn how to use PyMVPA it is best to start with the manual_ (`manual as
PDF`_). It explains
the basic concepts of the module and shows examples of a typical workflow.
The `API documentation`_  on the other hand provides comprehensive information
about all functionality included in PyMVPA.

If you want to contribute some code to PyMVPA you might also want to have a
look at some (few) `developer guidelines`_ (`devguide as PDF`_) to make your
code fit nicely into the PyMVPA codebase.

PyMVPA is developed inside the `Debian Experimental Psychology Project`_. This
website, the source code repository and download services are hosted on 
Alioth_, which is kindly provided by the `Debian project`_.

A development history including latest changes which are not yet released is
available from the changelog_.

Source code
~~~~~~~~~~~

Source code tarballs of PyMVPA releases are available from the `file release
system`_.

.. _file release system: http://alioth.debian.org/frs/?group_id=30954

To get access to both the full PyMVPA history and the latest
development code the PyMVPA Git_ repository is publicly available. To view the
repository, please point your webbrowser to gitweb:
http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-exppsy/pymvpa.git

To clone (aka checkout) the PyMVPA repository simply do:

::

  git clone git://git.debian.org/git/pkg-exppsy/pymvpa.git

After a short while you will have a `pymvpa` directory below your current
working directory, that contains the PyMVPA repository.

.. _Git: http://git.or.cz/


Binary packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Binary packages are not available yet, but will be when the first release of
PyMVPA has happened. And there will be a Debian_ package of course.

.. _Debian: http://www.debian.org



Building & Installation
-----------------------

Detailed instructions on how to `build PyMVPA from source`_ or `install binary
packages`_ are provided in the manual.
