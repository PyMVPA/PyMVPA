# PyLint configuration file for the project pymvpa.
#
# Agreed formatting (per yoh+michael voice dialog) is camel.
#
# This pylintrc file will use the default settings except for the
# naming conventions, which will allow for camel case naming as found
# in Java code or several libraries such as PyQt, etc.
#
# At some moment it was modified by yoh from the original one
# which can be found on debian systems at
# /usr/share/doc/pylint/examples/pylintrc_camelcase
#
# Just place it in ~/.pylintrc for user-wide installation or simply
# use within a call to pylint or export environment variable
# export PYLINTRC=$PWD/doc/misc/pylintrc
