.. glossary::

The literature concerning the application of multivariate pattern analysis
procedures to neuroscientific datasets contains a lot of specific terms to
refer to procedures or types of data, that are of particular importants.
Unfortunately, sometimes various terms refer to the same contruct and even
worse these terms do not necessarily match the terminology used in the machine
learning literature. The foloowing glossary is an attempt to map the various
terms found in the literature to the terminology used in this manual.


Block-averaging
---------------

Averaging all samples recorded during a block of continous stimulation in a
block-design fMRI experiment. The rationale behind this technique is, that a
averaging might lead to an improved signal-to-noise ratio. However, averaging
further decreases the number of samples in a dataset, which is already very low
in typical fMRI datasets, especially in comparsion to the number of
features/voxels. Block-averaging might nevertheless improve the classifier
performance, *if* it indeed improves signal-to-noise *and* the respective
classifier benefits more from few high-quaility samples than from a larger set
of lower-quality samples.


Chunk
-----

A chunk is a group of samples. In PyMVPA chunks define *independent* groups
of samples (note: the groups are independent from each other, not the samples
in each particular group). This information is important in the context of a
cross-validation procedure, as it is required to measured the classifier
performance on independent test datasets to be able to compute unbiased
generalization estimates. This is of particular importance in the case of
fMRI data, where two successively recorded volumes cannot be considered as
independent measurements. This is due to the significant temporal forward
contamination of the hemodynamic response whos correlate is measures by the
MR scanner.


Sensitivity
-----------


Sensitivity Map
---------------


Statistical Discrimination Map (SDM)
------------------------------------

This is another term for a `sensitivity map`_, used in e.g.
:ref:`Sato et al. (2008) <SMM+08>`.


Time-compression
----------------

This usually refers to the block-averaging_ of samples from a block-design fMRI
dataset.


Weight Vector
-------------
