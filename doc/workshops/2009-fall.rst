*********************************
Development Workshop -- Fall 2009
*********************************

This development workshop will take place at Dartmouth College (Nov 30th -- Dec
4th).


Goals
=====

The primary purpose of this first PyMVPA workshop is to gather all people
involved in (or related to) the development of PyMVPA. Participants will
introduce their projects and will discuss their integration into the PyMVPA
main line.

In addition, we will discuss changes scheduled for the upcoming 0.5 release of
PyMVPA that are supposed to improve shortcomings of the original design, or
missing features that have been identified over the past two years. This
includes:

* More flexible data storage: A new dataset implementation.
* Better integration of PyMVPA and MDP_.
* Establishing an optimization framework within PyMVPA.
* Various performance improvements, e.g. kernel-caching, parallelization,
  potential of CUDA.

.. _MDP: http://mdp-toolkit.sourceforge.net/
