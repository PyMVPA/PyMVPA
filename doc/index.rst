PyMVPA is a Python_ module intended to ease pattern classification analyses of
large datasets. In the neuroimaging contexts such analysis techniques are also
known as :term:`decoding` or :term:`MVPA` analysis. PyMVPA provides high-level
abstraction of typical processing steps and a number of implementations of some
popular algorithms.  While it is not limited to the neuroimaging domain, it is
eminently suited for such datasets.  PyMVPA is truly free software (in every
respect) and additionally requires nothing but free-software to run.

PyMVPA stands for **M**\ ulti\ **V**\ ariate **P**\ attern **A**\ nalysis
(:term:`MVPA`) in **Py**\ thon.

PyMVPA is developed inside the `Debian Experimental Psychology Project`_. This
website, the source code repository and download services are hosted on 
Alioth_, a service that is kindly provided by the `Debian project`_.

Binary packages
---------------

Binary packages are available for:

* Debian and Ubuntu (:ref:`installation instructions <install_debian>`)
    PyMVPA is an `official Debian package`_ (`python-mvpa`).
    Additionally, backports for some Debian and Ubuntu releases are also
    available. Please read the `package repository instructions`_ to learn
    about how to obtain them.

* RPM-based GNU/Linux distributions (:ref:`installation instructions <install_rpm>`)
    RPM packages are provided through the `OpenSUSE Build Service`_. The
    currently supported distributions include: CentOS 5, Fedora 9-10, Mandriva
    2007-2008, RedHat Enterprise Linux 5, SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, OpenSUSE
    10.2 up to 11.0. The build service supports RPM-package repositories (`Suse
    and Mandriva-related`_ and `Fedora, Redhat and CentOS-related`_) and
    `1-click-installations`_.

* MacOS X (:ref:`installation instructions <install_macos>`)
    PyMVPA is available from the MacPorts_ framework.

* Windows (:ref:`installation instructions <install_win>`)
    An installer for Python 2.5 is available from the `download area`_.

If there are no binary packages for your particular operating system or
platform, you need to compile your own. The manual contains :ref:`instructions
<buildfromsource>` to build PyMVPA in various environments.

Source code
-----------

Source code tarballs of PyMVPA releases are available from the `download
area`_. Alternatively, one can also download a tarball of the latest
development snapshot_ (i.e. the current state of the *master* branch of the
PyMVPA source code repository).

To get access to both the full PyMVPA history and the latest
development code, the PyMVPA Git_ repository is publicly available. To view the
repository, please point your webbrowser to gitweb:
http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-exppsy/pymvpa.git

To clone (aka checkout) the PyMVPA repository simply do:

::

  git clone git://git.debian.org/git/pkg-exppsy/pymvpa.git

After a short while you will have a `pymvpa` directory below your current
working directory, that contains the PyMVPA repository.

More detailed instructions on :ref:`installation requirements <requirements>`
and on how to :ref:`build PyMVPA from source <buildfromsource>` are provided
in the manual.

Support
=======

If you have problems installing the software or questions about usage,
documentation or something else related to PyMVPA, you can post to the PyMVPA
mailing list (preferred) or contact the authors on IRC:

:Mailing list: pkg-exppsy-pymvpa@lists.alioth.debian.org [subscription_,
               archive_]
:IRC: #exppsy on OTFC/Freenode

All users should subscribe to the mailing list. PyMVPA is still a young project
that is under heavy development. Significant modifications (hopefully
improvements) are very likely to happen frequently. The mailing list is the
preferred way to announce such changes. The mailing list archive can also be
searched using the *mailing list archive search* located in the sidebar of the
PyMVPA home page.
