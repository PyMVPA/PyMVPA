  The source tarball contains a partial copy of the LIBSVM package.  However,
  the corresponding library is available from the libsvm source package (or
  rather the binary packages it builds). Therefore this code is not used and
  the respective packages are used as dependencies. This copy of the libsvm
  code is, however, left in place, as it does not hurt and does not justify
  repackaging of the upstream sources.
