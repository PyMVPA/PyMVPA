pymvpa (0.4.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sandro Tosi ]
  * Drop Python 2.4; thanks to Luca Falavigna for the
    report and to Jakub Wilk for the patch (Closes: #562482)
    - debian/control
      + bump b-d on python-all-dev to '>= 2.5'
      + drop python-ctypes
      + drop explicit Depends on python: we use ${python:Depends}
    - debian/pyversions
      + bump it to '+2.5-'

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * debian/control
    - Thanks Sandro Tosi for NMU attempt to fix #560606.
    - Build-Conflict on python-epydoc=3.0.1-4: this version works
    incorrectly with python-docutils 0.6 (thanks to Lucas Nussbaum for the
    report).  Also Build-Depends on python-docutils (<< 0.6) |
    python-docutils (>= 0.6-3~) which would assure that we still can build
    on lenny or with fresh docutils which pull in fresh epydoc (thanks to
    Jakub Wilk for suggestion).  Those 2 steps fix the FTBFS (Closes:
    #560606)
    - Added python-mvpa-doc to suggests.
  * Cherry pick 2 commits from maint/0.4 branch to be compatible with recent
    versions of shogun-python-modular present in sid/squeeze.

pymvpa (0.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Removing the circular dependency between python-mvpa and python-mvpa-lib
    (Closes: #519129).
  * Improve long description of python-mvpa-lib and turn it into complete
    sentences, as recommended by the developers reference 6.2.3
    (Closes: #521332).
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1 -- no changes necessary.
  * Added dependency on python to the python-mvpa package to satisfy lintian.
  * Added rsync as build-dependency, which is required for building the docs.
  * The package now honors 'nodoc' in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. This is intended to
    help backporting to releases with insufficient python-sphinx versions.
  * Added 'graphviz' as a build-dependency (necessary for Sphinx' inheritance
    graphs).

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * Compatible with cdbs >= 0.4.54 (use of DEB_PYTHON_MODULE_PACKAGES) and
    recent pysupport (>=0.9).
  * Run unittests for each supported python version during build.

pymvpa (0.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Added missing ${misc:Depends} to debian/control.
  * The package now honors 'nocheck' in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Speed-up of package build process by preventing the docs from being built
    twice.
  * Added 'DM-Upload-Allowed: yes' to enable DM upload.
  * Install new manpages and add build-dep. to help2man.
  * Updated debian/copyright.
  * Imported various bugfixes from the upstream VCS that were pushed into the
    0.4 maintenance branch since the release of 0.4.1.

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * Adjusted long descriptions.
  * Split libraries (low-level SMLR implementation and LIBSVM custom
    Python bindings) into a separate python-mvpa-lib package. That allows
    python-mvpa package to become architecture independent.

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0 -- no changes necessary.
  * Adjusted list of recommended and suggested packages to the new
    capabilities of PyMVPA, i.e. add SciPy, MDP, Shogun and Matplotlib.
