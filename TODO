* Add support for topology support for stuff other than dense mask matrices,
  e.g. meshes.
* Hide libsvm interface from user and provide a unique classifier for linear
  SVM.
* (features selected on all folds)/(features selected on any fold)
* setup some conventions on names and formatting: camelback etc... may
   be should choose some confromant with pylint. if to go with
   camelback -- ask Yarik about pylintrc ;-)

   Michael's comment:
      We should probably use the official coding guidelines

      http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

      and not come up with something 'new'. The most important difference to the      current practice is that class methods should be all lowercase (separated
      by underscores) -- I consider this ugly, but for the sake of conformance
      I have no problem the fit future code to this scheme and modify old stuff,
      when touched for any other reason.
