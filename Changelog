Unreleased changes
  Changes described here are not yet released, but available from VCS
  repository.

  * Fixed :class:`~mvpa.measures.anova.OneWayAnova` to compute F-scores with
    expected distributions. Previous implementation did not properly took
    degrees of freedom into account.


Releases
========

* 0.4.2 (Mon, 25 May 2009)

  * New correlation stability measure
    (:class:`~mvpa.measures.corrstability.CorrStability`).
  * New elastic net classifier (:class:`~mvpa.clfs.enet.ENET`).
  * New GLM-Net regression/classifier (:class:`~mvpa.clfs.glmnet.GLMNET`).
  * New measure :class:`~mvpa.measures.anova.CompoundOneWayAnova`.
  * New measure :class:`~mvpa.measures.ds.DSMDatasetMeasure`.
  * New meta-measure
    :class:`~mvpa.measures.splitmeasure.TScoredFeaturewiseMeasure`.
  * New basic :class:`~mvpa.measures.glm.GLM` implementation.
  * New examples for Gaussian process regression.
  * New example showing a searchlight analysis employing a dissimilarity
    matrix based measure.
  * New :class:`~mvpa.mappers.zscore.ZScoreMapper`.
  * New import helper for FSL design matrices
    (:class:`~mvpa.misc.fsl.base.FslGLMDesign`).
  * New implementation of a mapper using a self-organizing map
    (:class:`~mvpa.mappers.som.SimpleSOMMapper`) and a corresponding example.
  * Matplotlib backend is now configurable via
    :envvar:`MVPA_MATPLOTLIB_BACKEND`.
  * PyMVPA version is now avialable from :data:`mvpa.__version__`.
  * Renamed `mvpa.misc.plot.errLinePLot` to
    :func:`~mvpa.misc.plot.plotErrLine` for consistency.
  * Fixed :class:`~mvpa.datasets.splitters.NFoldSplitter` to support N-3 and
    larger splits.
  * Improved speed of LIBSVM backend. Thanks to Valentin Haenel and Tiziano
    Zito.
  * Updated included LIBSVM version to 2.89.
  * Adjust LIBSVM Python interface for recent NumPy API and latest LIBSVM
    release 2.89.
  * Refactored examples parser into a standalone tool to turn PyMVPA examples
    into restructured text sources.

* 0.4.1 (Sat, 24 Jan 2009)

  * Unit tests and example data are now also installed. In conjuction with
    :func:`mvpa.test`, this allow to easily run unittests from within Python.
  * :class:`~mvpa.datasets.nifti.NiftiDataset` capable to handle files
    with less than 4 dimensions, which can, optionally, be provided as
    a list of filenames or :class:`~nifti.NiftiImage` objects. That
    makes it easy to load data from a sequence of files.

  * Changes (code refactorings) which *might impact* any user who
    imports from :mod:`~mvpa.suite`:

    - Pre-populated warehouses of classifiers and regressions are
      renamed from clfs and regrs into
      :data:`~mvpa.clfs.warehouse.clfswh` and
      :data:`~mvpa.clfs.warehouse.regrswh` respectively.
    - :class:`~mvpa.misc.io.hamster.Hamster` is not derived from
      :class:`dict` any longer -- just from a basic :class:`object` class.
      API includes methods 'dump', 'asdict' and a property 'registered'.

  * Changes (code refactorings) which *should not impact* any user who
    imports from :mod:`~mvpa.suite`:

    - Meta classifiers definitions moved from :mod:`~mvpa.clfs.base` into
      :mod:`~mvpa.clfs.meta`.
    - Splitters definitions moved from :mod:`~mvpa.datasets.splitter` into
      :mod:`~mvpa.datasets.splitters`


* 0.4.0 (Sat, 15 Nov 2008)

  * Add :class:`~mvpa.misc.io.hamster.Hamster`, as a simple facility to easily
    store any serializable objects in a compressed file and later on resurrect
    all of them with a single line of code.
  * SVM backend is now configurable via :envvar:`MVPA_SVM_BACKEND` (libsvm or
    shogun).
  * Non-deterministic tests in the unittest battery are now configurable via
    :envvar:`MVPA_TESTS_LABILE`.
  * New helper to determine and plot the best matching distribution(s) for
    the data (matchDistribution, plotDistributionMatches). It is WiP
    thus API can change in the upcoming release.
  * Simplifies API of mappers.
  * Splitters can now limit the number of splits automatically.
  * New :class:`~mvpa.mappers.base.CombinedMapper` to map between multiple,
    independent dataspace and a common feature space.
  * New :class:`~mvpa.mappers.base.ChainMapper` to create chains of mappers
    of abitrary lenght (e.g. to build preprocessing pipelines).
  * New :class:`~mvpa.datasets.event.EventDataset` to rapidly extract
    boxcar-shaped samples from data array using a simple list of
    :class:`~mvpa.misc.support.Event` definitions.
  * Removed obsolete MetricMapper class. :class:`~mvpa.mappers.base.Mapper`
    itself provides the facilities for dealing with metrics.
  * :class:`~mvpa.mappers.boxcar.BoxcarMapper` can now handle data with more
    than four dimensions/axis and also performs reverse mapping of single
    boxcar samples.
  * :class:`~mvpa.misc.fsl.base.FslEV3` can now convert EV3 files into
    a list of :class:`~mvpa.misc.support.Event` instances.
  * Results of tests for external dependencies are now stored in PyMVPA's
    config manager (`mvpa.cfg`) and can be stored to a file (not done
    automatically at the moment). This will significantly decrease the time
    needed to import the `mvpa` module, as it prevents the repeated and lengthy
    tests for working externals.
  * Initial support for ROC computing and AUC as an accuracy measure.
  * Weights of LARS are now available via :class:`~mvpa.clfs.lars.LARSWeights`.
  * Added an initial list of MVPA-related references to the manual, tagged with
    keywords and comments as well is DOI or similar URL reference to the
    original document.
  * Added initial glossary to the manual.
  * New 'Module reference', as a middle-ground between manual and API
    reference.
  * New manual section about meta-classifiers (contributed by James M.
    Hughes).
  * New minimal example for a 'getting started' section in the manual.
  * Former :envvar:`MVPA_QUICKTEST` was renamed to :envvar:`MVPA_TESTS_QUICK`.
  * Update installation instructions for RPM-based distributions to make use
    of the OpenSUSE Build Service.
  * Updated install instructions for several RPM-based GNU/Linux
    distributions.
  * Switch from distutils to numpy.distutils (no change in dependencies).
  * Depend on PyNIfTI >= 0.20081017.1 and gain a smaller memory footprint when
    accessing NIfTI files via all datasets with NIfTI support.
  * Added workaround to make PyMVPA work with older Shogun releases and those
    from 0.6.4 on, which introduced backward-incompatible API changes.


* 0.3.1 (Sun, 14 Sep 2008)

  * New manual section about feature selection with a focus on RFE.
    Contributed by James M. Hughes.
  * New dataset type :class:`~mvpa.datasets.channel.ChannelDataset` for data
    structured in channels. Might be useful for data modalities like EEG and
    MEG. This dataset includes support for common preprocessing steps like
    resampling and baseline signal substraction.
  * Plotting of topographies on heads. Thanks to Ingo Fründ for contributing
    this code. Additionally, a new example shows how to do such plots.
  * New general purpose function for generating barplots and candlestick plots
    with error bars (:func:`~mvpa.misc.plot.base.plotBars`).
  * Dataset supports mapping of string labels onto numerical labels, removing
    the need to perform this mapping manually in user code. 'clfs_examples.py'
    is adjusted accordingly to demonstrate the new feature.
  * New :meth:`mvpa.clfs.base.Classifier.summary` method to dump classifier
    settings.
  * Improved and more flexible :func:`~mvpa.misc.plot.erp.plotERPs`.
  * New :class:`~mvpa.measures.irelief.IterativeRelief` sensitivity analyzer.
  * Added visualization of confusion matrices via
    :meth:`mvpa.clfs.transerror.ConfusionMatrix.plot` inspired by Ingo Fründ.
  * The PyMVPA version is now globally available in :data:`mvpa.pymvpa_version`.
  * BugFix: :class:`~mvpa.misc.io.meg.TuebingenMEG` reader failed in some cases.
  * Several improvements (docs and implementation) for building PyMVPA on
    MacOS X.
  * New convenience accessor methods (:meth:`~mvpa.datasets.base.Dataset.select`,
    :meth:`~mvpa.datasets.base.Dataset.where` and
    :meth:`~mvpa.datasets.base.Dataset.__getitem__`) for
    :class`~mvpa.datasets.base.Dataset`.
  * New :func:`mvpa.seed()` function to configure the random number generators
    from user code.
  * Added reader for a MEG sensor locations format
    (:class:`~mvpa.misc.io.meg.TuebingenMEGSensorLocations`).
  * Initial model selection support for GRP (using openopt).
  * And tons of minor bugfixes, additional tests and improved documentation.


* 0.3.0 (Mon, 18 Aug 2008)

  * Import of binary EEP files (used by EEProbe) and EEPDataset class.
  * Initial version of a meta dataset class (MetaDataset). This is a container
    for multiple datasets, which behaves like a dataset itself.
  * Regression performance is summarized now within RegressionStatistics.
  * Error functions: CorrErrorPFx, RelativeRMSErrorFx.
  * Measures: CorrCoef.
  * Data generators: chirp, wr1996
  * Few more examples: curvefitting, kerneldemo, smellit, projections
  * Updated kNN classifier. kNN is now able to use custom distance function
    to determine that nearest neighbors. It also (re)gained the ability to do
    simple majority or weighted voting.
  * Some initial convenience functions for plotting typical results and data
    exploration.
  * Unified configuration handling with support for user-specific and
    analysis-specific config files, as well as the ability to override all
    config settings via environment variables. The configuration handling is
    used for PyMVPA internal settings, but can also be easily used for
    custom (user-)settings.
  * Improved modularity, e.g. SciPy is not required anymore, but still very
    useful.
  * Initial implementations of ICA and PCA mapper using functionality provided
    by MDP. These mappers are more or less untested and should be used with
    great care.
  * Further improved docstrings of some classes, but still a long way to go.
  * New 'boxcar' mapper, which is the similar to the already present
    transformWithBoxCar() function, but implemented as a mapper.
  * New SampleGroupMapper that can be used for e.g. block averaging of
    samples. See new FAQ item.
  * Stripped redundant suffixes from module names, e.g.
    mvpa.datasets.niftidataset -> mvpa.datasets.nifti
  * mvpa.misc.cmdline variables opt* and opts* were groupped within
    opt and optss class instances. Also names of the options were
    changed to match 'dest' of the options. Use tools/refactor.py to
    quickly fix your custom code.
  * Change all references to PyMVPA website to www.pymvpa.org.
  * Make website stylesheet compatible with sphinx 0.4.
  * Several minor improvements of the compatibilty with MacOS.
  * Extended FAQ section of the manual.
  * Bugfix: doubleGammaHRF() ignoring K2 argument.


* 0.2.2 (Tue, 17 Jun 2008)

  * Extended build instructions: Added section on OpenSUSE.
  * Replaced ugly PYMVPA_LIBSVM environment variable to trigger compiling the
    LIBSVM wrapper with a proper '--with-libsvm' switch in setup.py.
    Additionally, setup.py now detects if included LIBSVM has been built and
    enables LIBSVM wrapper automatically in this case.
  * Added proper Makefiles for LIBSVM copy, with configurable compiler flags.
  * Added 'setup.cfg' to remove the need to manually specify swig-opts
    (Windows specific configuration is in 'setup.cfg.win').


* 0.2.1 (Sun, 15 Jun 2008)

  * Several improvements to make building PyMVPA on Windows systems easy
    (e.g. added dedicated Makefile.win to build a binary installer).
  * Improved and extended documentation for building and installing PyMVPA.
  * Include a minimal copy of the required (patched) LIBSVM library (currently
    version 2.85.0) for convenience. This copy is automatically compiled and
    used for the LIBSVM wrapper when PyMVPA built using the `Make` approach.


* 0.2.0 (Wed, 29 May 2008)

  * New Splitter class (HalfSplitter) to split into first and second half.
  * New Splitter class (CustomSplitter) to allow for splits with an arbitrary
    number of datasets per split and the ability to specify the association
    of samples with any of those datasets (not just the validation set).
  * New sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR) classifier and
    associated sensitivity analyzer.
  * New least angle regression classifier (LARS).
  * New gaussian process regression classifier (GPR).
  * Initial documentation on extending PyMVPA.
  * Switch to Sphinx for documentation handling.
  * New example comparing the performance of all classifiers on some
    artificial datasets.
  * New data mapper performing singular value decomposition (SVDMapper) and an
    example showing its usage.
  * More sophisticated data preprocessing: removal of non-linear trends and
    other arbitrary confounding regressors.
  * New `Harvester` class to feed data from arbitrary generators into multiple
    objects and store results of returned values and arbitrary properties.
  * Added documentation about how to build patched libsvm version with sane
    debug output.
  * libsvm bindings are not build by default anymore. Instructions on how to
    reenable them are available in the manual.
  * New wrapper from SVM implementation of the Shogun toolbox.
  * Important bugfix in RFE, which reported incorrect feature ids in some
    cases.
  * Added ability to compute stats/probabilities for all measures and transfer
    errors.


* 0.1.0 (Wed, 20 Feb 2008)

  * First public release.
