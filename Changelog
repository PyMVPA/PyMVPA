Unreleased changes
  Changes described here are not yet released, but available from VCS
  repository.

  * New Splitter class (HalfSplitter) to split into first and second half.
  * New Splitter class (CustomSplitter) to allow for splits with an arbitrary
    number of datasets per split and the ability to specify the association
    of samples with any of those datasets (not just the validation set).
  * New sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR) classifier and
    associated sensitivity analyzer.
  * New least angle regression classifier.
  * Initial documentation on extending PyMVPA.
  * New example comparing the performance of all classifiers on some
    artificial datasets.
  * More sophisticated data preprocessing: removal of non-linear trends and
    other arbitrary confounding regressors.
  * New `Harvester` class to feed data from arbitrary generators into multiple
    objects and store results of returned values and arbitrary properties.
  * Added documentation about how to build patched libsvm version with sane
    debug output.
  * Important bugfix in RFE, which reported incorrect feature ids in some
    cases.
  * New wrapper from SVM implementation of the Shogun toolbox.
  * libsvm bindings are not build by default anymore. Instructions on how to
    reenable them are available in the manual.
  * Switch to Sphinx for documentation handling.
